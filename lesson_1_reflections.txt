Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug
that was introduced?

A: diff showed what changes had occured from the editing of the original file.


Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a 
more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: It would make debugging easier, because we could go back to when the file
was working correctlly.


Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google Docs does?

A: Pro would be, you have more control of when/why a commit gets created.
Con would be, you could end up forgetting to commit.


Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each
file separately?

A: I think Git allows multiple files to be saved with one commit because
sometimes a change that's made affects multiple linked files.


Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
of files?

A: Git log will show all the commits that have been made in a repository.
Git diff will show what changes were made between two files.
